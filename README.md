# Reading-time-from-clock-images-using-CNN
Used CNN to read time from clock images. Also, tested our CNN using MNIST and Fashion MNIST

This project was done for a deep learning course I took in Leiden University.

Task 1: Use CNN to read and classify the digits the images. The data is the famouse MNIST dataset.

Task 2: Use CNN to read the classify from the images. The data is the fashione MNIST dataset.

Task 3: Use CNNs to predict the time from clock images. We used different types of CNNs to test which type of CNN performed the best.

Some tested CNNs are: Regression CNN, Classification CNN, Periodic function CNN
